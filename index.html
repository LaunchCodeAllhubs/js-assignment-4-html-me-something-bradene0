         <h1>No Fuss Foccacia</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This is one of my favorite recipes for focaccia. It is from the 
         King Arthur Baking Company website. The yield is one 9" by 13" loaf, and
         it should take about two hours 
      </p>

         <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Use non-stick vegetable oil spray to lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.
                Drizzle about 2 tablespoons (25g) of the olive oil atop the spray;
                the spray keeps the bread from sticking,
                while the olive oil gives the bottom crust great flavor and a bit of crunch.</li>
            <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
                Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons (35g) of the olive oil with the rest of the dough ingredients,
                and beat at high speed with an electric mixer for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Scoop the sticky batter into the prepared pan, cover the pan,
                and let it rise at room temperature for 60 minutes — it should be quite puffy, but not fragile-looking.</li>
            <li>While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
            <li>Gently poke the dough all over with your index finger.</li>
            <li>Drizzle it lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with pizza seasoning, and/or the dried herbs of your choice, if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread until it's golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove it from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
